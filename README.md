This project was created as educational objective about deep neural net, a series of neural net will be conventionally divided into two part, CNN and RNN. <br>

All of docs will be written in English. Present theoretical background on deep learning and mathematically, logically describe contents, implement this based on computer engineering. Finally, propose results and conclusion.
